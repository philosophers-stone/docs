# Contributing to Philosopher's Stone Shadow Repositories

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved!

Also make sure you read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that
outlines our commitment towards an open and welcoming environment.

## Purpose

The shadow repositories are meant to be a place to collect all
the great ideas that don't quite meet the standards for inclusion
in the core Elixir Libraries.

## Naming Conventions

Every repository and module in the Philosopher's Stone organization
lives in the PhS namespace. If you want to add a new function for
`Enum`, you would submit a PR to the phs-enum repository in the
module `PhS.Enum`.

## Expectations

The intent of Philosopher's Stone is to create a place for robust
maintainable Elixir Libraries. This means that documentation and
tests are a high priority. The expectation is that a PR to one
of the shadow repositories will have good `@doc` entries for each
function. It will have tests and if at all possible doctests.

Thank you for your contributions!
