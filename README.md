# Charter
Charter for the Philosopher's Stone Organization

## Purpose
The Philosopher's Stone Organization has two main objectives: 

* Provide a place for one-off utility functions for the core Elixir libraries. 
* Provide a community for supporting useful libraries that are not in Elixir Core.

## Guidelines 

* A common namespace: 
  Every module must live under either the PhS. namespace or a namespace specific
  to the repository.

* All repos must follow semantic versioning.
* All repos must be 1.0 before appearing in the PhS. namespace. 

## License
All repos in this organization should have the same license as the Elixir src code.
