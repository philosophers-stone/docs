# Charter
Charter for the Philosopher's Stone Organization

## Purpose
The Philosopher's Stone Organization has two main objectives: 

* Provide a place for one-off utility functions for the core Elixir libraries. 
* Provide a community for supporting useful libraries that are not in Elixir Core.

## Guidelines 

* A common namespace: 
  Every module must live under the PhS. namespace.

* All repos must follow semantic versioning.
* All repos must be 1.0 before appearing in the PhS. namespace.
