# Contributing to Philosopher's Stone Useful Repositories

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved!

Also make sure you read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that
outlines our commitment towards an open and welcoming environment.

## Purpose

The useful repositories are meant to be a place share the burden of
maintaining an Elixir library that is commonly used.

## Naming Conventions

Every repository and module in the Philosopher's Stone organization
lives in the PhS namespace. If you want to add a new repository for
an existing library `Useful`, you would submit a request to the core
member to add the repository phs-useful. Every module in this repository
must live under the PhS. namespace.

## Expectations

The intent of Philosopher's Stone is to create a place for robust,
maintainable Elixir Libraries. This means that any repositories added
in the useful category have passed the 1.0 version. The intent is to
help share the burden of maintaining a robust open source library.
This implies tests and documentation for all public functions and
that the code can be maintained by interested parties.

Thank you for your contributions!
